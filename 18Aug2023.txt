Hi all, 

Today I had a interview which went pretty bad. 
The interview was about Java, Spring, Spring Boot. 

I was able to answer few questions only. 
The Questions was about
    - Collection frameworks in Java. 
        - Usage of collection in java. 
        - Different types of collections. 
        - HashMaps, Hashsets, what will you use when. 
        - hashcode(), if we want to insert in the hashMap any object. 
        - Multithreading. 
        - Difference between  spring Beans and Component 
        - What to use when, constructor injection vs setter injection and why. 
        - @RestController and @Controller difference. 
        - Spring MVC. 
        - View Resolver.  
    - Threads and their methods, like sleep, wait, does these methods retain or release locks. 
    - About what java version are we talking about. 
    - What java features does that offer. 
    - About streams, intermedial and terminal methods. 
    - How does set works inside. 

I understand that these are theoritical questions, and these is must have. But in day to day, we are not using them. 
Practical knowledge and Interview questions are too different. 
I need to change the way I work.    
        - Need to make sure I am growing right amount of skills in right direction. 
        - Need to make sure constantly, whether I am learning anything or not. 


Few Points to Keep Note of. 
    - Practical learning and Theoritical learning both should go hand in hand. 
    - keep yourself updated in tech, to grow and learn. 
    - Keep giving interviews. 
    - Keep updating a CV. 
    - Keep writing Blogs and experience.
